## Prerequisites

If relevant, indicate any steps the reviewer must complete in order to process
the request.

## Review type

While pull requests often cover multiple scenarios they generally fall into one
or more common types, which should be indicated here:

- [ ] **Content/copy:** proofreading (often _README.md_ or other documentation)
      for grammar and spelling mistakes
- [ ] **FYI:** PR author is simply giving the reviewer/s a heads-up about a
      certain change. Reviewer simply needs to acknowledge, discuss if needed,
      then approve the Review.
- [ ] **Needs feedback:** PR author requests feedback or needs a question
      answered by the reviewer before proceeding.
- [ ] **Functionality:** something changed in the UI (either style,
      functionality, both, or something else). In most cases the reviewer should
      visit the auto-generated deploy that can be found below.
- [ ] **Code:** at the time of writing the repo is private and the team only has
      one developer, so code reviews are unlikely unless either of those things
      change.

## Items to ignore

The reviewer should skip or overlook these items as they are already part of
another, or the PR author is at least aware of them, or they are outside the
scope of the PR.

## What to review (issue-specific)

If this is not already sufficiently defined by the issue/s to be closed,
describe the items requiring review.

- [ ] All checkboxes in the issue/s mentioned have been completed.
- [ ] The issue/s in this request have been resolved.

## What to review (regardless of issue)

- [ ] **Front-end errors:** no DevTools console errors occur in the built code
      (PR review URL) in the step/s required to test the PR.
- [ ] **Style:** cohesive _visual design_ is preserved relative the rest of the
      site. Colors, type, and layout blend appropriately with the surrounding
      elements.

### Content changes

- [ ] Content is free of typos, grammar/spelling mistakes, and unclear wording.
- [ ] **README sections:** document outline makes sense semantically (proper use
      of heading levels, lists, tables, etc.).
- [ ] **README formatting:** proper use of `code`, _/paths/to/files/and.stuff_,
      and **emphasis** when needed.
- [ ] **README headings:** should be "First word capitalized" rather than "Some
      Kind of Other Approach", and should have **unique names** (a Markdown
      linter will catch this).

### Code changes

**NOTE:** leaving this section intact for posterity and to serve as a reminder
that it should be re-introduced once this project is made public. For now, the
former items can be found in detail
